# Next gen CV assistant:

**The problem:** the process of applying for a job, creating a CV, going through interviews is not a simple process, especially for people with visual impairments. As an applicant, it is important to fully present oneself as they are, their skills and competences so that it is easier for employers to decide whether their company is a good match.

This assistant allows for audio input from the user (voice) and based on the userâ€™s speech, it generates a CV (curriculum vitae). It uses Whisper for voice recognition and ChatGPT / GPT3 for paraphrasal and formation of structured text CV.
